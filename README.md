## Usage

### clean_ecr_images

Locates and deletes stale docker images stored in Amazon ECR.

An ECR image is considered stale when:

1. It was created over `--e` days ago (default: 60).
2. It's not being used by any ECS active task definition.

#### Listing images eligible for cleanup:

```
$ awsclean clean_ecr_images
```

```

```

### clean_amis

Locates and deletes stale Amazon Machine Images (AMI).

An AMI is considered stale when:

1. It was created over `--e` days ago (default: 60).
2. It's not being used by any EC2 instance.

#### Listing images eligible for cleanup:

```
$ awsclean clean_amis
```

The following flags are available to use in both commands:

* `--c`: delete images marked as eligible for cleanup. (default: false)
* `--e`: images older than `--e` days are considered old. (default: 60)
* `--r`: select which AWS regions to perform on. (default: all)

The `--r` flag accepts a space separated list of region names.

```
$ awsclean clean_amis -r us-east-2 ca-central-1
```

## Development

To release a new version, update the version number in
`version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create
a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the
